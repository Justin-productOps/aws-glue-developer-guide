# Tutorial: Set Up PyCharm Professional with a Development Endpoint<a name="dev-endpoint-tutorial-pycharm"></a>

This tutorial shows you how to connect the [PyCharm Professional](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) Python IDE running on your local machine to a development endpoint so that you can interactively run, debug, and test AWS Glue ETL \(extract, transfer, and load\) scripts before deploying them\. The instructions and screen captures in the tutorial are based on PyCharm Professional version 2019\.3\.

To connect to a development endpoint interactively, you must have PyCharm Professional installed\. You can't do this using the free edition\.

The tutorial assumes that you have already taken the steps outlined in [Tutorial Prerequisites](dev-endpoint-tutorial-prerequisites.md)\.

**Note**  
The tutorial uses Amazon S3 as a data source\. If you want to use a JDBC data source instead, you must run your development endpoint in a virtual private cloud \(VPC\)\. To connect with SSH to a development endpoint in a VPC, you must create an SSH tunnel\. This tutorial does not include instructions for creating an SSH tunnel\. For information on using SSH to connect to a development endpoint in a VPC, see [Securely Connect to Linux Instances Running in a Private Amazon VPC](http://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/securely-connect-to-linux-instances-running-in-a-private-amazon-vpc/) in the AWS security blog\.

## Connecting PyCharm Professional to a Development Endpoint<a name="dev-endpoint-tutorial-pycharm-connect"></a>

1. Create a new pure\-Python project in PyCharm named `legislators`\.

1. Create a file named `get_person_schema.py` in the project with the following content:

   ```
   from pyspark.context import SparkContext
   from awsglue.context import GlueContext
   
   
   def main():
       # Create a Glue context
       glueContext = GlueContext(SparkContext.getOrCreate())
   
       # Create a DynamicFrame using the 'persons_json' table
       persons_DyF = glueContext.create_dynamic_frame.from_catalog(database="legislators", table_name="persons_json")
   
       # Print out information about this data
       print("Count:  ", persons_DyF.count())
       persons_DyF.printSchema()
   
   
   if __name__ == "__main__":
       main()
   ```

1. Do one of the following:
   + For AWS Glue version 0\.9, download the AWS Glue Python library file, `PyGlue.zip`, from `https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-glue-jes-prod-us-east-1-assets/etl/python/PyGlue.zip` to a convenient location on your local machine\.
   + For AWS Glue version 1\.0 and later, download the AWS Glue Python library file, `PyGlue.zip`, from `https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-glue-jes-prod-us-east-1-assets/etl-1.0/python/PyGlue.zip` to a convenient location on your local machine\.

1. Add `PyGlue.zip` as a content root for your project in PyCharm:
   + In PyCharm, choose **File**, **Settings** to open the **Settings** dialog box\. \(You can also press `Ctrl+Alt+S`\.\)
   + Expand the `legislators` project and choose **Project Structure**\. Then in the right pane, choose **\+ Add Content Root**\.
   + Navigate to the location where you saved `PyGlue.zip`, select it, then choose **Apply**\.

    The **Settings** screen should look something like the following:  
![\[The PyCharm Settings screen with PyGlue.zip added as a content root.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/images/PyCharm_AddContentRoot.png)

   Leave the **Settings** dialog box open after you choose **Apply**\.

1. Configure deployment options to upload the local script to your development endpoint using SFTP \(this capability is available only in PyCharm Professional\):
   + In the **Settings** dialog box, expand the **Build, Execution, Deployment** section\. Choose the **Deployment** subsection\.
   + Choose the **\+** icon at the top of the middle pane to add a new server\. Set its **Type** to `SFTP` and give it a name\.
   + Set the **SFTP host** to the **Public address** of your development endpoint, as listed on its details page\. \(Choose the name of your development endpoint in the AWS Glue console to display the details page\)\. For a development endpoint running in a VPC, set **SFTP host** to the host address and local port of your SSH tunnel to the development endpoint\.
   + Set the **User name** to `glue`\.
   + Set the **Auth type** to **Key pair \(OpenSSH or Putty\)**\. Set the **Private key file** by browsing to the location where your development endpoint's private key file is located\. Note that PyCharm only supports DSA, RSA and ECDSA OpenSSH key types, and does not accept keys in Putty's private format\. You can use an up\-to\-date version of `ssh-keygen` to generate a key\-pair type that PyCharm accepts, using syntax like the following:

     ```
     ssh-keygen -t rsa -f <key_file_name> -C "<your_email_address>"
     ```
   + Choose **Test connection**, and allow the connection to be tested\. If the connection succeeds, choose **Apply**\.

    The **Settings** screen should now look something like the following:  
![\[The PyCharm Settings screen with an SFTP server defined.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/images/PyCharm_SFTP.png)

   Again, leave the **Settings** dialog box open after you choose **Apply**\.

1. Map the local directory to a remote directory for deployment:
   + In the right pane of the **Deployment** page, choose the middle tab at the top, labeled **Mappings**\.
   + In the **Deployment Path** column, enter a path under `/home/glue/scripts/` for deployment of your project path\. For example: `/home/glue/scripts/legislators`\.
   + Choose **Apply**\.

    The **Settings** screen should now look something like the following:  
![\[The PyCharm Settings screen after a deployment mapping.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/images/PyCharm_Mapping.png)

   Choose **OK** to close the **Settings** dialog box\.

## Deploying the Script to Your Development Endpoint<a name="dev-endpoint-tutorial-pycharm-deploy"></a>

1. Choose **Tools**, **Deployment**, and then choose the name under which you set up your development endpoint, as shown in the following image:  
![\[The menu item for deploying your script.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/images/PyCharm_Deploy.png)

   After your script has been deployed, the bottom of the screen should look something like the following:  
![\[The bottom of the PyCharm screen after a successful deployment.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/images/PyCharm_Deployed.png)

1. On the menu bar, choose **Tools**, **Deployment**, **Automatic Upload \(always\)**\. Ensure that a check mark appears next to **Automatic Upload \(always\)**\.

   When this option is enabled, PyCharm automatically uploads changed files to the development endpoint\.

## Configuring a Remote Interpreter<a name="dev-endpoint-tutorial-pycharm-interpreter"></a>

Configure PyCharm to use the Python interpreter on the development endpoint\.

1. From the **File** menu, choose **Settings**\.

1. Expand the project **legislators** and choose **Project Interpreter**\.

1. Choose the gear icon next to the **Project Interpreter** list, and then choose **Add**\.

1. In the **Add Python Interpreter** dialog box, in the left pane, choose **SSH Interpreter**\.

1. Choose **Existing server configuration**, and in the **Deployment configuration** list, choose your configuration\.

   Your screen should look something like the following image\.  
![\[In the left pane, SSH Interpreter is selected, and in the right pane, the Existing server configuration radio button is selected. The Deployment configuration field contains the configuration name and the message "Remote SDK is saved in IDE settings, so it needs the deployment server to be saved there too. Which do you prefer?" The following are the choices beneath that message: "Create copy of this deployment server in IDE settings" and "Move this server to IDE settings."\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/images/PyCharm_Interpreter1.png)

1. Choose **Move this server to IDE settings**, and then choose **Next**\.

1. In the **Interpreter** field, change the path to` /usr/bin/gluepython` if you are using Python 2, or to `/usr/bin/gluepython3` if you are using Python 3\. Then choose **Finish**\.

## Running Your Script on the Development Endpoint<a name="dev-endpoint-tutorial-pycharm-debug-run"></a>

To run the script:
+ In the left pane, right\-click the file name and choose **Run '*<filename>*'**\.

  After a series of messages, the final output should show the count and the schema\.

  ```
  Count:   1961

  |-- name: string
  |-- links: array
  |    |-- element: struct
  |    |    |-- note: string

  Process finished with exit code 0
  ```

You are now set up to debug your script remotely on your development endpoint\.
